# Quick Start Guide: Enhanced Sequential Thinking

This guide shows you how to use the enhanced sequential thinking tools in the better-chatbot system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Using Reasoning Tools in Chat

Simply mention `@reasoning` in your chat to invoke the reasoning tools:

```
@reasoning I need to plan a migration from monolith to microservices.
Help me think through this systematically.
```

The system will:

- Break down the problem into steps
- Generate hypotheses about the best approach
- Plan the tools needed for implementation
- Consider risks and alternatives

### 2. Available Reasoning Commands

**Sequential Thinking:**

```
@reasoning analyze [problem] - Multi-step analysis with revision capability
@reasoning debug [issue] - Systematic debugging approach
@reasoning design [system] - Architecture and design thinking
```

**Strategic Planning:**

```
@reasoning plan [project] - Comprehensive project planning
@reasoning risks [scenario] - Risk assessment and mitigation
@reasoning compare [options] - Compare multiple approaches
```

**Tool Integration:**

```
@reasoning research [topic] - Research with tool chain execution
@reasoning implement [feature] - Implementation planning with tools
```

## üí° Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: System Design

**Input:**

```
@reasoning I need to design a real-time chat application that can handle 100k concurrent users. Help me think through the architecture systematically.
```

**What happens:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: Breaks down scaling requirements
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: Proposes architectural patterns (WebSocket servers, message queues, database sharding)
3. **Research Planning**: Plans tools to research best practices
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential bottlenecks
5. **Implementation Strategy**: Creates step-by-step implementation plan

### Scenario 2: Debugging Complex Issues

**Input:**

```
@reasoning Our API is experiencing intermittent timeouts under load. The error rate spikes to 15% during peak hours but returns to normal during off-peak times.
```

**What happens:**

1. **Symptom Analysis**: Analyzes the pattern (load-dependent, intermittent)
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: Proposes causes (connection pool exhaustion, database locks, memory pressure)
3. **Investigation Plan**: Plans diagnostic tools and monitoring
4. **Evidence Collection**: Guides systematic data gathering
5. **Solution Strategy**: Develops mitigation and fixes

### Scenario 3: Technology Migration

**Input:**

```
@reasoning plan We need to migrate our React app from JavaScript to TypeScript while maintaining development velocity and minimizing bugs.
```

**What happens:**

1. **Migration Strategy**: Analyzes incremental vs. big-bang approaches
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential issues (build breaking, team learning curve)
3. **Phased Approach**: Creates detailed migration phases
4. **Success Metrics**: Defines measurable outcomes
5. **Contingency Plans**: Prepares fallback strategies

## üõ† Advanced Usage

### Workflow Integration

Create visual workflows with reasoning nodes:

1. **Add Reasoning Node**: In workflow builder, add a "Reasoning" node
2. **Configure Mode**: Choose Sequential, Planning, or Hybrid
3. **Set Parameters**: Configure thinking depth and tool integration
4. **Connect Flow**: Link to other workflow nodes

### Custom Reasoning Sessions

For complex problems, start extended reasoning sessions:

```
@reasoning start session: microservices migration planning
- Enable branching logic for exploring alternatives
- Set thinking depth to comprehensive
- Auto-execute research and analysis tools
- Generate risk assessment and mitigation plans
```

### API Integration

Use reasoning tools programmatically:

```typescript
import { enhancedSequentialThinkingTool } from "@/lib/ai/tools/thinking/enhanced-sequential-thinking";

const result = await enhancedSequentialThinkingTool.execute({
  thought: "Starting systematic analysis of performance bottleneck",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 10,
  contextUpdate: {
    key: "focus_area",
    value: "database_performance",
  },
});
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Effective Reasoning

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and constraints

   ```
   ‚ùå "Help me with my app"
   ‚úÖ "Help me design a scalable chat app for 100k users with real-time messaging"
   ```

2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what success looks like

   ```
   ‚ùå "Make it better"
   ‚úÖ "Reduce API response time to under 100ms while maintaining 99.9% uptime"
   ```

3. **Embrace Iteration**: Let the reasoning evolve and refine
   ```
   ‚úÖ "Actually, let me reconsider the database choice based on new constraints..."
   ```

### For Strategic Planning

1. **Start with Constraints**: Define limitations upfront

   ```
   "We have 3 developers, 8-week timeline, and $50k budget"
   ```

2. **Consider Stakeholders**: Think about all affected parties

   ```
   "This affects the development team, operations, and end users"
   ```

3. **Plan for Uncertainty**: Build in flexibility
   ```
   "What if the third-party API changes? What if we get 10x more users?"
   ```

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Reasoning Progress

Watch for these indicators of effective reasoning:

- **Hypothesis Refinement**: Ideas get more specific and testable

3. Evidence gathering
4. Solution synthesis
5. Implementation planning

**Planning Pattern:**

1. Goal clarification
2. Constraint identification
3. Approach comparison
4. Risk assessment
5. Resource planning
6. Timeline creation

**Debugging Pattern:**

1. Symptom analysis
2. Root cause hypotheses
3. Investigation planning
4. Evidence collection
5. Solution development
6. Verification strategy

## ü§î Tips and Tricks

### Getting Better Results

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with general analysis, then focus
2. **Question Assumptions**: Challenge initial thoughts and hypotheses
3. **Seek Evidence**: Support conclusions with concrete data
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Explore multiple solution paths
5. **Plan Implementation**: Think through practical execution steps

### Troubleshooting

**If reasoning seems to loop:**

- Provide more specific constraints or goals
- Ask for a summary of progress so far
- Switch to a different reasoning mode

**If suggestions seem generic:**

- Provide more context about your specific situation
- Mention constraints, requirements, and preferences
- Ask for more detailed analysis of specific aspects

**If you need faster results:**

- Use "basic" instead of "comprehensive" planning depth
- Focus on specific sub-problems rather than entire systems
- Skip branching exploration for time-critical decisions

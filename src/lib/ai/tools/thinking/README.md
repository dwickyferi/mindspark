Strategic planning tool for comprehensive project planning and analysis.

```typescript
// Strategic planning usage
const plan = await reasoningPlannerTool.execute({
  problem: "Implement a real-time collaborative system",
  approach: "systematic",
  steps: [
    /* detailed implementation steps */
  ],
  riskAssessment: {
    majorRisks: ["Technical complexity", "User adoption"],
    mitigations: ["Prototyping", "User testing"],
  },

- **Alternative Approaches**: Evaluate different implementation strategies
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable outcomes

### 3. Tool Chain Manager

Orchestrates the execution of multiple tools based on reasoning outcomes.

```typescript
// Tool chain execution
const result = await executeReasoningToolChain(
  reasoningContext,
  availableTools,
  { query: "analysis parameters" }
);
```

**Key Features:**

- **Dependency Resolution**: Execute tools in correct order based on dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tools concurrently for efficiency
- **State Management**: Track execution progress and intermediate results
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures with graceful fallback strategies

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Chat Interface Usage

Use the reasoning tools directly in chat with `@reasoning` mentions:

```
@reasoning I need to design a scalable microservices architecture.
Help me think through this systematically with hypothesis testing.
```

### Workflow Integration

Create reasoning nodes in the visual workflow builder:

1. **Sequential Reasoning Node**: For step-by-step analysis
2. **Planning Node**: For strategic project planning
3. **Hybrid Node**: Combines reasoning with tool execution

### API Integration

```typescript
import { enhancedSequentialThinkingTool } from "@/lib/ai/tools/thinking/enhanced-sequential-thinking";

// In your application logic
const reasoningResult = await enhancedSequentialThinkingTool.execute({
  thought: "Starting analysis of the performance bottleneck",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 8,
  contextUpdate: {
    key: "analysis_focus",
    value: "performance_optimization",
  },
});
```

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

The reasoning system integrates seamlessly with the existing workflow builder:

### Reasoning Node Types

1. **Sequential**: Multi-step reasoning with revision capabilities
2. **Planning**: Strategic planning with risk assessment
3. **Hybrid**: Combines reasoning with automated tool execution

### Node Configuration

```typescript
interface ReasoningNodeData {
  mode: "sequential" | "planning" | "hybrid";
  maxThoughts?: number;
  enableBranching?: boolean;
  enableRevision?: boolean;
  autoExecuteTools?: boolean;
  planningDepth?: "basic" | "detailed" | "comprehensive";
}
```

## üìö Advanced Features

### Hypothesis Testing

```typescript
// Generate and test hypotheses
{
  hypothesisGenerated: "The performance issue is caused by database query inefficiency",
  hypothesisVerification: {
    evidence: ["Query execution time analysis", "Database logs"],
    conclusion: "supported" | "refuted" | "inconclusive"
  }
}
```

### Branching Logic

```typescript
// Explore alternative reasoning paths
{
  branchFromThought: 3,
  branchId: "alternative-approach",
  thought: "Let me explore a different architectural pattern..."
}
```

### Tool Planning

```typescript
// Plan tool sequences during reasoning
{
  toolPlan: [
    {
      toolName: "web-search",
      purpose: "Research best practices",
      expectedOutput: "Industry standards and patterns",
      dependencies: [],
    },
    {
      toolName: "code-analyzer",
      purpose: "Analyze current implementation",
      dependencies: ["web-search"],
    },
  ];
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Setup

The reasoning tools are automatically configured and available in:

1. **Chat Interface**: Use `@reasoning` to invoke reasoning tools
2. **Workflow Builder**: Add reasoning nodes to visual workflows
3. **API Endpoints**: Available through the tool execution API

### Customization

Modify tool behavior in `src/lib/ai/default-tool-kit.ts`:

```typescript
// Customize reasoning tool registration
{
  category: ToolkitCategory.Reasoning,
  tools: [
    enhancedSequentialThinkingTool,
    reasoningPlannerTool,
    // Add custom reasoning tools here
  ]
}
```
